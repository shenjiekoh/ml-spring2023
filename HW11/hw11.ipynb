        "Now we have labeled source data and unlabeled target data, where source data might be relavent to the target data. We now want to train a model with source data only and test it on target data.\n",
        "\n",
        "What problem might occur if we do so? After we have learned Anomaly Detection, we now know that if we test the model with an abnormal data that have never appeared in source data, our trained model is likely to result in poor performance since it is not familiar with the abnormal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we have a model that contains Feature Extractor and Classifier:\n",
        "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IL0PxCY.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
        "\n",
        "When the model is trained with source data, the feature extractor \n",
        "will extract meaningful features since it is familiar with the distribution of it.It could be seen in the following figure that the blue dots, which is the distribution of source data, has already been clustered into different clusters. Therefore, the Classifier can predict the label based on these clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when test on the target data, the Feature Extractor will not be able to extract meaningful features that follow the distribution of the source feature distribution, which result in the classifier learned for the source domain will not be able to apply to the target domain.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Domain Adversarial Training of Nerural Networks (DaNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the above problems, DaNN approaches build mappings between the source (training-time) and the target (test-time) domains, so that the classifier learned for the source domain can also be applied to the target domain, when composed with the learned mapping between domains.\n",

        "\n",
        "In DaNN, the authors added a Domain Classifier, which is a deep discriminatively-trained classifeir in the training framework to distinguish the data from different domain by the features extracted by the feature extractor. As the training progresses, the approach promotes a domain classifier that discriminates between the source and the target domains and a feature extractor that can extractor features that are discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The feature extractor are likely to outperform the domain classifier as its input are generated by the feature extractor and that the task of domain classification and label classification are not conflict.\n",
